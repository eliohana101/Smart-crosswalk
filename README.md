 Steps of project execution
 
   Description
   People are sometimes run over in a crosswalk.
   Sometimes there are hit and run accidents in which the victim is left in a   crosswalk sometimes without the possibility of calling for help.

   Suggestion for this problem.
   Placing a device is able to detect in real-time people are run over in a   crosswalk and the device calls for help via SMS or automatic call.


   Project structure

   * Preparation of a database
     Photographing a vehicle that overturns a person at a crosswalk, I used my vehicle
     And a random crosswalk I found in one of the cities.

   * Labeling the database and dividing it into categories.

   * Entering the database into the YOLOV5-S object identification network

   * Transfer the grid with the weights to the Invidia Jetson Nano controller.
