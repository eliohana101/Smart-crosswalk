---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Description:
  
   People are run over in a crosswalk on occasion there are also hit and run accidents. in which case the victim is left in the 
   crosswalk without the possibility of calling for help.

   Suggestion for this problem.
   Placing a device at the crosswalk that can detect real-time pedestrian accidents in a crosswalk and the device calls for help via SMS or automatic call.


   Project structure : 
  * Preparation of a database Photographing a vehicle that overturns a person at a crosswalk, I used my vehicle And a random crosswalk I found in one of the cities.

  * Labeling the database and dividing it into categories.

  * Entering the database into the YOLOV5-S object identification network.

  * Transfer the grid with the weights to the Invidia Jetson Nano controller.
