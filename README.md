Steps of project execution

Steps for project execution

1) People are sometimes run over in a crosswalk.
   Sometimes there are hit and run accidents in which the victim is left in a crosswalk sometimes without the possibility of calling for help.


2) Suggestion to try to help the problem.

   Placing a device that detects live when people are run over in a crosswalk and the device calls for help via SMS or automatic call.


3) Project structure

3.1 Preparation of a database
Photographing a vehicle that overturns a person at a crosswalk, I used my vehicle
And a random crosswalk I found in one of the cities.

3.2 Labeling the database and dividing it into categories.

3.3 Entering the database into the YOLOV5-S object identification network

3.4 Transfer the grid with the weights to the Invida Jetson Nano controller.
